We took a first stab at developing a standard to measure machine tool energy consumption as part of a project supported by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">General Dynamics – OTS, NationalCenter for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (NCDMM), and AMT. We developed theBaseline Energy Consumption (BEC) metric as a standard measure of the energyconsumption of machine tools along with a companion test methodology. Applicationsof this metric include:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"></div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;">Estimating the approximate energyrequirements of operating a machine tool to manufacture a specific part</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;">Comparing the energy requirements oftwo machine tools that are being applied in similar activities</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;">Performing Return-on-Investmentcalculations to justify energy efficiency improvements in machine tool andmachining technologies</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;">Assessing environmental impact ofmanufacturing processes from equipment energy consumption</span></li></ul><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A key consideration in designing the test methodology was toensure that they could be performed within a reasonable amount of a time in astandard industrial setting without requiring any special workpieces, fixtures,or equipment. This pragmatic approachwas explicitly selected because the goal of this metric is to serve as a figureof merit for the energy consumption of machine tools and manufacturingequipment. This metric does not intend to serve as a precise indication of theenergy required by a machine tool to manufacture a specific part or to executea specific operation. The first edition of the standard focused on measuringthe BEC of lathe-type machine tools based on recording the power consumptionduring a series of controlled tests. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The energy consumption of a machine tool in a factoryenvironment is determined by the relative time it spends in different states,including, idle, axes movement, and cutting. To capture the effect of thesestates, the baseline tests measure the average power consumption during tare usage,axes / component usage, and machining usage. Tare usage is measured based onthe power consumption of the machine tool when it is in standby with itsperipheral units turned on. Component usage is measured based on the power consumptionwhen the machine tool components are being exercised, without any loadedworkpiece (analogous to “air-cutting”). Machining usage is measured based on powerconsumption &nbsp;during metal cutting at afixed spindle speed at varying material removal rates on an arbitrary workpiece.These tests are based on the observation that the energy required to removeunit volume of material in a machine tool is largely dependent on thevolumetric rate of removal, or material removal rate, and not on the process parameters.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The BEC metric is based on the average power consumed duringthese states. The three terms are weighted by duration factors to estimate theenergy consumed by the machine during one hour of representative operation,where it is assumed that the machine tool spends 25% of the duration in tareusage, 25% in component usage (air-cutting/warmup etc.,) and 50% in machiningusage.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We will be following up with case studies looking at how this standard was applied in comparing different machine tools.</span></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6756902581348409489-2865333385100592988?l=www.manufacturingbigdata.com' alt='' /></div>
